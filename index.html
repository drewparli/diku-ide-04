          <h2>Visualizing the Spectrum</h2>
          <p>This assignment asked us to look at visualizing a dataset composed of hands and the principal component analysis (PCA) that had been performed. In very basic terms, PCA takes a dataset of high dimensionality in one coordinate system (or in linear algebra terms, a base) and looks for another coordinate system that can more effectively describe the variation in the data. This means that if we sort the principal components by the amount of variance in the dataset they describe, then what we typically call the first principal component will explain the most variance. Likewise, the second principal component will explain the second most variance. The outlines to the left and the scatter plot below it can help us better understand this notion graphically. Be sure to hover the mouse over each section as you are reading so that the example graphic can be displayed.</p>

          <div id="pca-example-1">
          <h2>The First Component</h2>
          <p>Lets look at the first principal component. In terms of the scatter plot, we can think of it as being the distance in the x-axis. Therefore, if you are hovering with your mouse over this text, you will see two highlighted points. These points represent the two hands in the dataset furthest apart in terms of the first principal component. Not suprisingly, they also represent the two extremes that we could imagine. The light green outline shows a hand whose fingers are very close together, while the dark green outline shows a hand whose fingers are very far apart. Now we better understand what was stated earlier in terms of the principal components describing or explaining the variance in the dataset. So we can conclude that the first principal component describes to a large degree how far apart all the fingers of the hard are from each other.</p>

          <h2>The Second Component</h2>
          <p>Now lets look at the second principal component. In terms of the scatter plot, this can be thought of as the y-axis. Here, we can see that again, the two points furthest from each other in terms of the second principal component show two very different hands. We might conclude that to a larger degree, this component is describing the range of motion in the thumb, as well as the middle, ring and little fingers. To a less degree it is also picking up on smaller variations in the index finger.</p>

          <h2>Andrew</h2>
          <p>I chose to implement a few different interactive extensions. First, I wanted to make it possible for a user to scroll through the dataset. I felt that for me, this provided more freedom to quickly flip through the dataset. This was acheived using the zoom portion of the d3 library.</p>
          <p>Second, I created the left-hand panel that shows all the points for a hand outline. This is then updated as the user scrolls through the dataset. I also implemented similar behaviour for the PCA scatter plot to show the component values. I recognize that this does not say much about PCA in general, but I took it as an exercise in how to use d3 to update a large number of text at once.</p>
          <p>Third, I implemented the examples for the descriptions of the first and second components above. This consisted of highlighting the two most extreme points for each component so that the reader could gain a more intuitive understanding of what each principal component was explaining in this dataset.</p>

          <h2>Viktorija</h2>
          <p>I implemented a tooltip when the mouse hovers over its point in the PCA panel. 
          The tooltip displays the datafile row index.</p>
		      <p>In addition to this I added two buttons <i>PCA 1–2</i> and <i>PCA 1–3</i>. 
          When you press on the first one it displays the first two principal components in the panel. 
          After pressing the second button, you can see a visualization of the first and the third PCA-variables. 
          The points smoothly change their positions. We decided not to add more PCA-variables since the first three 
          explain most of the variation.</p>

          <h2>Petur</h2>

          <p>I added colouring of individual toggled data points and
          rectangular selection. Using unique colors for data points helps with
          comparison of smaller sets of data points which have interesting
          correlations and promotes a richer analysis. The colouring is handled
          via a global pool of available colours. We decided to include as
          varied hues as possible while also avoiding using the other
          highlighting colours we have, like red and grey. To save the viewer
          from dealing with large sets of selected points with very minor
          differences in colour between them, we only add color to the first 5
          points which are selected - the rest of coloured black.</p>

          <p>The selection code is inspired by the solution found in <a
             href="https://gist.github.com/vwochnik/712c8131afc9b0be7f57a3dde95be47a"
             target="_blank">this gist</a>. Certain choices made in their code
           need to be implemented to adapt the solution, but the logic is the
           same. On the end event, when a selection has been made, the
           selection window's boundaries are checked and the colouring
           algorithm from before is employed.</p>
